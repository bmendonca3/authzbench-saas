# Project Goal

AuthZBench-SaaS is being built to become a top benchmark for one narrow,
important question:

> Can an AI agent prove SaaS authorization failures with backend evidence, while
> avoiding false positives when the application is behaving correctly?

The current repository is an alpha/pre-v0 public preview. It is useful for
reviewing the idea, running the harness, and comparing early agents on a small
public split. It is not yet a finished leaderboard benchmark, and the project
should not claim the real `v0` label until the release gates below are met.

## Operating Contract

### Outcome

Turn AuthZBench-SaaS from a promising alpha into a credible, researcher-usable
benchmark for multi-tenant SaaS authorization reasoning. A strong score should
mean an agent can reason through actors, roles, tenants, organizations, objects,
API tokens, sharing links, secure controls, and replayable HTTP evidence.

The benchmark should reward agents that:

- prove vulnerable behavior with replayable backend evidence
- name the correct actor, role, tenant, organization, object, and scope boundary
- distinguish allowed access from broken authorization
- avoid findings on secure controls
- stay inside the benchmark policy and target scope

The benchmark should penalize agents that:

- guess from route names or task wording alone
- submit polished prose without replayable proof
- over-report every sensitive endpoint
- rely on memorized public manifests instead of live reasoning
- ignore tenant, role, token, or object boundaries

### Verification Surface

Progress toward a release-worthy benchmark must be backed by concrete evidence:

- unit tests, manifest validation, compile checks, and Docker Compose validation
- deterministic scorer transcripts and scripted sanity baselines
- live HTTP target smoke tests and target-side request-log correlation when
  Docker is available
- repeated real model or agent baselines with exact commands, model labels,
  commit SHAs, result bundles, and variance notes
- private holdout validation outside public Git history
- privacy scans proving no secrets, personal paths, private holdouts, cookies,
  tokens, or unrelated local data are committed
- sectional panel review notes under `docs/reviews/` for major benchmark areas
- fresh public-clone validation before public release claims

### Constraints

- Keep the public repo honest as alpha/pre-v0 until the v0 gates pass.
- Keep the benchmark focused on SaaS authorization, not generic CTF coverage.
- Keep synthetic data synthetic; do not copy real customer, employer, bug bounty,
  school, or personal data.
- Keep private holdouts out of public Git history.
- Do not let headline scores hide false-positive behavior.
- Do not present one-off model runs as stable leaderboard results.
- Do not commit raw panel logs, local captures, result bundles, secrets, or
  personal/private information.

### Boundaries

Work should stay inside the benchmark repo and its ignored local evidence
folders. Public-facing changes belong in docs, tasks, apps, scorer/harness code,
tests, baseline summaries, and release artifacts. Externally visible GitHub work
must use the public `github.com` repo, the configured maintainer author identity,
and normal commits at meaningful SDLC checkpoints.

High-blast-radius actions require explicit review before proceeding: publishing
a release tag, changing leaderboard scoring semantics, exposing private holdouts,
rewriting public history, adding real-world data, or changing external GitHub
state beyond ordinary commits and pushes for this repo.

### Iteration Policy

Improve the benchmark section by section:

1. Define the section's purpose and threat model.
2. Add or update target behavior, tasks, scorer logic, docs, and tests.
3. Run focused local verification.
4. Run sectional panel review and record accepted/rejected findings.
5. Fix valid findings.
6. Refresh baselines or status docs when behavior changes.
7. Commit at a natural SDLC checkpoint with a clear message.
8. Re-run public validation and privacy scans before pushing.

If a section cannot be fully validated because Docker, model quota, credentials,
or private holdout infrastructure is unavailable, record the gap plainly and
continue with the strongest safe local work.

### Blocked Stop Condition

Do not claim the benchmark is `v0`, leaderboard-ready, or top-tier if any core
proof surface is missing: private holdouts, repeated real baselines, live-target
proof, anti-gaming controls, privacy validation, release review, or public-clone
validation. If a blocker requires unavailable infrastructure or user action,
record the exact blocker, preserve the evidence gathered, and keep the goal
active rather than downgrading the standard.

## v0 Release Goal

The real `v0` goal is to ship the first version that other researchers can use
without mentally discounting every headline score.

To call the project `v0`, the repo should have:

- 6 synthetic SaaS apps
- 40-50 public tasks
- 20-30 private holdout tasks outside public Git history
- at least 40 percent secure controls, counting both denial controls and
  authorized-allow controls
- at least 10 authorized-allow controls that prevent "everything is a bug"
  strategies
- route aliases, decoys, seeded IDs, and multi-seed private holdouts
- target/proxy-side request logs correlated into per-task result artifacts
- repeated baselines across at least five real model or agent families
- one or more tool-equipped agent baselines, not only no-tools model runs
- CI, live Docker validation, and fresh public-clone validation
- sectional panel review for goal, roadmap, and release criteria; task realism
  and vulnerability/control mix; scorer, runner, request-log correlation, and
  live-target proof; baseline methodology and leaderboard schema; holdout,
  contamination, and anti-gaming design; and privacy scan, packaging, and final
  release readiness
- public docs that clearly separate alpha results, public-split development
  results, and private-holdout leaderboard results

Until those gates are met, the honest label is alpha/pre-v0.
